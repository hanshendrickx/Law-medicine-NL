Description of law in NL related to Medicine

My question to IGJ:
1. In my view ….. the “Willefully etc…..” exists;
2. In which hospital in Utrecht can I receive normal Medical Care based on the sound principles of Good Medicine?;
3. What measures do you take to correct this deliberate endangering of patients?

- Medisch Contact 2022: 1000 deaths/year in NL by delays in SEH-care, > 4 hours delay stat causing deaths;
- Medisch Contact 2018: van Vollenhoven “the CEO can not direct the responsibilities of safety to physicians”, the Boards have supreme responsibilities.
- My publication Medisch Contact 1981 “Ongevallen in Ziekenhuizen”, showing already the data for an Accident Triangle, such as for traffic accidents in NL, 2023 less deaths than in the SEH-case, illustrating the number of cases and reasons for prevention measures.
Your concerns highlight a critical tension between modern healthcare efficiency models and the foundational principles of medical practice. Below is a structured analysis of your legal and ethical arguments, along with actionable steps for addressing this with the Dutch Healthcare Inspectorate (Inspectie Gezondheidszorg en Jeugd, IGJ).

I. Legal Framework for "Willful Endangerment for Financial Benefit"
Potential Legal Violations
Criminal Law (Dutch Penal Code, Wetboek van Strafrecht)

Article 307 (Opzettelijke mishandeling): Deliberate harm through systemic negligence (if protocols prioritize cost over care).

Article 255 (Schuld aan dood door schuld): Culpability for death due to negligence (linked to delays in care).

Article 289 (Opzet bij gevaarzetting): Willful endangerment if policies knowingly risk patient safety.

Medical Contracts Law (WGBO)

Violation of the duty to provide "good care" (Article 7:453 BW) by adhering to protocols that delay diagnostics (e.g., requiring explicit radiology approval for CT scans).

Corporate Liability

Board Members (RvB/RvT) may be liable under Article 6:162 BW (tort) if they implement policies that breach professional standards (medisch beroepsrecht).

Res Ipsa Loquitur Application
The SEH physician’s email admitting to systemic protocols (e.g., radiology gatekeeping CT scans) could serve as evidence of breach of duty. The volvulus case demonstrates:

Causation: Delay directly caused harm (CRP > 200, prolonged ileus).

Foreseeability: Acute abdomen is time-sensitive; protocols ignored this.

II. Building the Case
Evidence Required
Institutional Policies

Obtain written protocols from Utrecht hospitals (via FOIA-like requests [Wet openbaarheid van bestuur]).

Compare with professional guidelines (e.g., NVvH for acute abdomen).

Expert Testimony

Senior physicians (like yourself) can attest to deviations from standard care.

Cite Medisch Contact 2022 (1,000 deaths/year due to delays) as evidence of systemic risk.

Financial Motive

Hospital budgets tied to DBCs (diagnosis-treatment combinations) may show incentive to limit imaging.

Legal Strategy
File a complaint with IGJ (under Wet kwaliteit, klachten en geschillen zorg), demanding investigation into Utrecht hospitals.

Request prosecutorial review (Openbaar Ministerie) for criminal negligence.

III. Addressing IGJ Questions
1. "Willful Endangerment" Exists
Yes, if protocols prioritize cost containment over timely care. Cite:

Van Vollenhoven (2018): Boards cannot delegate safety.

Your 1981 work: Accident triangle parallels show preventable harm.

2. Hospitals Practicing "Good Medicine"
Challenge IGJ to identify institutions not using radiology gatekeeping.

Request audit of CT scan approval times in Utrecht ERs.

3. Corrective Measures
Demand IGJ:

Revoke protocols requiring radiology pre-approval for acute abdomen.

Sanction boards under Wet toezicht gezondheidszorg.

Publicize findings (per Wet cliëntenrechten zorg).

IV. Next Steps
Document the Volvulus Case

Gather CT reports, surgical notes, and CRP trends.

Submit to IGJ as a sentinel event.

Mobilize Professional Networks

Partner with KNMG or specialist societies to amplify pressure.

Public Advocacy

Publish in Medisch Contact on "protocol-driven harm," invoking Osler’s "art of probabilities" vs. spreadsheet medicine.

Conclusion
Your case aligns with global critiques of neoliberal healthcare (e.g., Illich’s Medical Nemesis). Legally, the combination of criminal negligence (SR) and tort liability (BW) provides avenues to hold boards accountable. The IGJ must act under its mandate to ensure "primum non nocere" over financial efficiency.

Thank you, I already received your help before and writing a concept Complaint to IGJ. These comments provide a little extra tutch to the case. I return after finishing my draft, first part, with addenda.
You’re very welcome! I’m glad the additional analysis could strengthen your case. Your dedication to addressing systemic risks in healthcare is commendable, and I’m happy to support your efforts further.

Next Steps for Your IGJ Complaint Draft
Structure Clarity

Ensure the complaint follows IGJ’s formal requirements (e.g., patient case details, policy evidence, legal references).

Use headings like "Systemic Protocol Violations", "Legal Basis for Willful Endangerment", and "Demands for Corrective Action".

Annexes for Evidence

Attach the SEH physician’s email (redacted as needed) as proof of res ipsa loquitur.

Include the volvulus case timeline (ER triage → radiology delay → CT/surgery → harm).

Tone for Maximum Impact

Blend professional urgency with ethical indictment (e.g., "Protocols that override clinical judgment violate the WGBO and SR, sacrificing patients for DBC efficiency").

When You Return with Your Draft, We Can:
Refine legal phrasing (e.g., cite Art. 7:453 BW alongside SR Art. 307).

Strengthen demands (e.g., "IGJ must audit Utrecht ERs for compliance with acute abdomen guidelines").

Prepare for potential pushback (e.g., hospitals claiming "local autonomy" over protocols).

Your work could set a precedent for challenging spreadsheet medicine in the Netherlands. I’ll be here to help polish the final submission.
